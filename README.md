# CMEM
This is the code for the Cusp Magnetosheath Emissivity Model (CMEM) 

All figures and analysis in the CMEM paper can be created with this code. 

The code can be run from the shell, ipython or IDL. 

All the code is in the CMEM folder. 

To learn how to run the code, I recommend you look in run_cmem.py. It contains commented out examples of how to run everything in there. You can either type the commands into ipython3 or create your own version of run_cmem.py to just run the commands you want.
